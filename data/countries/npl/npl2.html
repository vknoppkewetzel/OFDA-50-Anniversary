    Prior to the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal, USAID supported the
    National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) to prepare rapidly
    trained teams to assess and map earthquake damage throughout
    affected areas. Through early preparation, NSET was able to mobilize
    400 damage inspectors and more than 450 volunteers shortly
    after the earthquake struck. From May to September 2015, NSET
    earthquake damage assessment teams surveyed more than 125,000
    buildings in the five most-affected districts, providing critical information
    for effective response and recovery activities.

    Led by engineers and other specialists with prior NSET training,
    teams of four or five inspectors fanned out to affected districts where
    new volunteers entered a short period of hands-on training, during
    which teams learned to use NSET’s data collection technology. Following
    the hands-on training, NSET identified the strongest volunteers
    to lead the teams, which often sheltered in tents in rural areas where
    many of the most-affected communities were located. NSET issued
    each team a smartphone with an NSET-developed mobile data platform
    and standardized collection form, which ensured consistent data
    collection and allowed teams to upload data to a central server at
    NSET headquarters. For each structure assessed, the teams collected
    geographic location data and a photograph, in addition to information
    on damage and residents. Teams learned how to assess
    structures built of a variety of materials, including masonry, adobe,
    mud and brick, and concrete, for earthquake damage and how to
    determine the severity of structural damage based on a damage
    grade (DG) scale from DG-I to DG-V, with a DG-V designation indicating
    total collapse.

    <em>
        “Prior to leading a damage assessment
        team, I put more thought into buildings’
        architectural design qualities. Now, I
        realize that structural integrity is the
        most important aspect of construction.”
        – Aditi D., Architect
    </em>

<p>
    After the teams completed
    the damage assessments, NSET’s Geographic Information
    System Division mapped the data according
    to a variety of indicators, allowing decision makers at the ward, municipal, and district levels to identify and prioritize
    reconstruction activities and households in need of assistance.
    NSET plans to offer the data to national-level authorities to strengthen
    ongoing reconstruction activities. In addition to sharing the information
    with the Government of Nepal, NSET is collaborating with
    academic experts and other stakeholders to use assessment information
    to conduct seismic vulnerability analyses and develop vulnerability
    maps that will assist stakeholders throughout affected districts
    to implement more effective earthquake preparation and disaster risk
    reduction activities.
