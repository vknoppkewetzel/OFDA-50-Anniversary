    USAID has supported the National Society for Earthquake Technology
    (NSET) since 1997 to implement the School Earthquake Safety
    Program (SESP), which aims to strengthen school buildings and raise
    earthquake safety awareness among teachers, students, and parents
    in Nepal. Prior to the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck less than
    50 miles from the capital city of Kathmandu in April 2015, NSET had
    retrofitted 115 schools, primarily in the Kathmandu Valley, to withstand
    earthquake shaking. During the earthquake, none of the retrofitted
    schools collapsed.

    Damage assessments conducted by the Government of Nepal Department
    of Education (DoE) revealed that more than 27,000 public
    school classrooms were completely destroyed during the April 2015
    earthquake, while an additional 26,000 classrooms sustained substantial
    damage. In many earthquake-affected communities, retrofitted
    schools were among the few structures that did not sustain
    significant damage. Following the earthquake, the schools served as
    emergency shelters and humanitarian distribution points since communities
    and relief agencies trusted the structural integrity of the modified
    buildings. Local residents and educators expressed gratitude for
    the safe space, particularly during the numerous aftershocks experienced
    in the weeks following the initial earthquake.


</p>

<p>
    Due to the success of SESP and NSET’s consistent advocacy efforts,
    the DoE has institutionalized NSET’s retrofitting methods. NSET has
    provided technical support to the DoE for planning, budgeting, and
    implementing SESP activities, targeting 260 public schools in the
    Kathmandu Valley. 

</p>

<p>
    NSET also provides training to educate students and teachers about
    ways to safely respond during earthquakes. For example, students
    are taught to quickly “drop, cover, and hold on” when an earthquake
    strikes. Students then carry their knowledge and skills home to share
    with their families, further disseminating earthquake awareness.
</p>


<p>SESP is a component of NSET’s Building Code Implementation Plan
in Nepal (BCIPN) program, which is designed to enhance the capacity
of municipal governments to develop and administer building permits
and control systems to reduce the vulnerability of buildings to earthquake
shaking. To date, NSET has worked with more than 200 municipalities
in Nepal to strengthen building code compliance. In
districts affected by the April 2015 earthquake, approximately 1,500
BCPIN-compliant buildings have been constructed since 2013—or
half of all new buildings during that period; no building code compliant
buildings collapsed during the earthquake.  </p>
