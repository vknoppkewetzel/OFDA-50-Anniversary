            <span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">
                USAID’s sustained support for
                disaster management training
                in Nepal has strengthened
                Nepal’s capacity to respond
                effectively when disaster
                strikes.

    The importance of USAID support for the Program for the Enhancement
    of Emergency Response (PEER) was evident on April 25, 2015,
    when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck less than 50 miles from
    Nepal’s capital city of Kathmandu. Immediately following the earthquake,
    more than 1,000 PEER-trained personnel used their
    knowledge and skills to save lives and provide critical medical care.

</p>

<p>
    Since 1998, USAID has supported PEER to assist local, regional, and
    national disaster management authorities to organize and conduct
    trainings in medical first response (MFR); collapsed structure searchand-rescue
    (CSSR); community action for disaster response
    (CADRE); and hospital preparedness for emergencies (HOPE). In
    Nepal, PEER partners include the Nepal Police, the Armed Police
    Force, the Nepalese Army, and the Nepal Red Cross Society.

    In the immediate aftermath of the April 2015 earthquake, more than
    500 PEER-trained CSSR and MFR graduates from Nepal’s security
    forces deployed to earthquake-affected areas, rescuing people
    trapped in buildings and providing life-saving medical care prior to the
    arrival of international search-and-rescue and disaster response
    teams. Since Nepal’s CSSR and MFR trainings conform to international
    standards, rescue teams that arrived in Nepal from around the
    world were able to collaborate effectively in rescue efforts. In coordination
    with other search-and-rescue teams, CSSR teams from
    Nepal’s security forces rescued nearly 350 people. Additionally, more
    than 600 CADRE-trained volunteers—including more than 150 trained
    through OFDA’s PEER program—provided immediate emergency
    assistance in their communities prior to the arrival of professional first
    response personnel.

</p>

<p>
    By implementing best practices identified through the HOPE training
    course, including developing a disaster response plan and implementing
    non-structural mitigation techniques, such as fastening oxygen
    cylinders to walls and laminating windows, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan
    University Teaching Hospital remained operational when the April
    2015 earthquake struck. As a result, hospital staff were able to provide
    medical care to approximately 700 earthquake survivors and
    perform more than 300 earthquake-related surgeries in the days following
    the disaster.
</p>


<p>In April 2015, PEER-trained first responders quickly and effectively
responded to the critical emergency needs of those affected by the
earthquake. In 2016, USAID continues to support the PEER program
to provide training in essential, life-saving skills that allow the people
of Nepal to better prepare for and respond to disasters. </p>
