    When the magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck central Nepal on April 25,
    Sita Shrestha knew what to do. She found a place near an inner wall of
    her house to wait out the shaking with her five-month-old daughter and
    told her six-year-old son, who was on a different floor, to do the same.
    When the shaking stopped, Sita grabbed her ‘go bag’—a disaster preparedness
    kit—and took her children to a safe, open space in the courtyard.
    Using the tarpaulin from the go bag, she made an emergency
    shelter for her family. She also used disinfectant from the kit to treat her
    children’s wounds and passed out medicines to neighbors with headaches
    and other minor ailments. Additional supplies from the bag,
    including chlorine to purify water, a head lamp, soap, and toothpaste,
    proved invaluable in the days following the earthquake, according to
    Sita, who made use of every item in her kit.
</p>

<p>
    Sita attributes her capable response during and after the April 25 earthquake
    to a preparedness course she took in 2013, conducted by USAID
    partner the National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET). The
    NSET training taught Sita how to protect herself during an earthquake
    and the importance of having an emergency kit in her home, which
    NSET provided to course participants. Sita retained the knowledge
    gained from NSET and shared it with her family, but she did not fully
    realize the value of the go bag until the April 25 earthquake struck.

<p>
    “Since I got training on earthquake preparedness and emergency response…I
    had told my children and other family members not to panic
    and not to run inside the home or use the staircase…but stay at the safe
    place and go outside once the shaking stops,” remarked Sita. “I also
    learned about the need to store the emergency kit from the training. I
    knew that the go bag was important and so have kept one myself, but I
    had not imagined that our go bag could be that useful in this situation.”
</p>

<p>
    The training Sita received was a component of the larger USAID-funded
    Nepal Earthquake Risk Management Project, through which NSET
    coordinated long-term disaster risk reduction planning and worked with
    the Government of Nepal, local schools, and communities like Sita’s to
    increase earthquake awareness and preparedness. NSET implemented
    the program in two phases between March 2011 and April 2015, training
    more than 4,000 people and distributing more than 600 go bags during
    the second phase. The program focused on Kathmandu Valley and
    other urban areas of Nepal, including Kathmandu city, four submetropolitan
    cities, 53 municipalities, and 135 small towns.
