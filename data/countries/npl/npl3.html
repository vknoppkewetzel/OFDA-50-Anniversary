    Along with 16 women from the Thankot Women’s Cooperative
    Network, Ms. Shrestha attended an NSET non-structural mitigation
    workshop in 2012, where attendees learned techniques to
    fasten and anchor household items to walls and floors. Following
    the workshop, Ms. Shrestha and other cooperative members
    taught the non-structural mitigation techniques to other people in
    their communities, including staff at local schools, health clinics,
    and one of Nepal’s largest hospitals, the Patan Teaching Hospital.

    Non-structural mitigation workshops play a key part in community
    preparedness by reducing the number of casualties at the household
    level. Furthermore, education and training empower people
    to spread awareness messages and safety techniques throughout
    their communities, allowing them to exert a measure of control
    over the effects of earthquakes. Ms. Shretha’s story of implementing
    the non-structural mitigation techniques that helped her family
    remain unharmed during the April 2015 earthquake is representative
    of the experiences of hundreds of households that NSET has
    reached with earthquake safety trainings.

    NSET conducts non-structural damage mitigation trainings through
    the USAID-supported Nepal Earthquake Risk Management Project
    (NERMP), which aims to institutionalize disaster risk reduction
    activities in Nepal through earthquake-resistant construction trainings,
    seismic vulnerability assessments, homeowner consultations
    for household retrofitting, and community-based earthquake safety
    awareness activities. During the April 2015 earthquake, communities
    involved in NERMP activities demonstrated increased awareness
    of appropriate safety practices, reducing the earthquake’s
    adverse impacts.
