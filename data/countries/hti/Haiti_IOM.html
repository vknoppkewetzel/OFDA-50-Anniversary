<p>In April 2011&mdash;a little more than a year after the deadly January 2010 earthquake that rocked Haiti&mdash;the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Haiti Disaster Risk Reduction Unit (DRR) began a program in Port&ndash;au&ndash;Prince to help vulnerable communities better prepare for and respond to future disasters. Focusing on camp residents and vulnerable communities, the program educates and trains people on how to conduct temporary evacuations for future hurricanes and floods.</p> 

<p>Many people have received life&ndash;saving training on community first aid and disaster risk mitigation through this program. First aid kits and other materials such as shovels, wheelbarrows, and rakes, have been distributed in camps for displaced people and in vulnerable communities to help clean up their communities and stock up for future crises. &#147;This program has had a very positive impact on my life. Before, there was a lot of trash accumulated in the canals, but this program has provided the training and materials needed to keep them clear. The program also helps us live better in our community because now we know what to do before, during and after a natural disaster hits,&#148; said Rosena Sabin, who has been living in the Immacul&#233;e Conception camp for internally displaced persons in the Commune of Cit&#233;&ndash;Soleil since the 2010 earthquake.</p>

<p>Learning how to evacuate people in the event of a future emergency has proven exceptionally helpful to local residents, especially the guidance on helping neighbors with disabilities. It&#146;s no guarantee that Haiti can be safeguarded from future earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, but this program is helping prepare Haitians to better respond&mdash;hopefully saving lives if and when the next big one hits.</p>
