<p>
    After decades of war, the people of South Sudan celebrated the
    opportunity to determine their own destiny by choosing independence
    in a historic referendum in January 2011.
</p>

<p>Among those fleeing are thousands of children lost from their families&mdash;heaping tragedy upon tragedy. Some were sent to safety by parents who could not afford a journey to safety themselves. Others became separated from their parents during the recent violence that has ravaged their country and left them traumatized.</p>
<p>
    Recognizing the history of prolonged conflict in Sudan, USAID
    and the humanitarian community proactively began contingency
    planning in 2009 to address humanitarian needs during the potentially
    volatile referendum period in late 2010 and early 2011.
    USAID pre-positioned emergency relief supplies and food assistance
    in strategic locations throughout South Sudan. USAID
    also created a rapid response fund managed by the International
    Organization on Migration that could swiftly provide funding
    to experienced organizations to respond to a wide range of
    situations. USAID and its partners coordinated closely with the
    U.N. to maximize resources and efforts.
</p>


<p>
    Although Sudan’s referendum period passed without crisis, violence
    broke out in May 2011 in the contested Abyei Area, displacing
    an estimated 110,000 people primarily into South
    Sudan less than two months prior to Independence Day.
</p>
<p>
    The robust early planning efforts for the referendum enabled
    humanitarian agencies to respond immediately to the Abyei crisis.
    Aid organizations quickly distributed urgently needed relief
    items from the pre-positioned stockpiles, reaching approximately
    68,000 individuals. The U.N. World Food Program provided
    emergency food assistance to more than 100,000 displaced
    people congregated in the border areas and delivered threemonth
    food rations to displaced populations in southern Abyei
    before the rainy season rendered the roads impassable. Due
    to careful preparation, all immediate humanitarian needs of the
    displaced population were met in less than a month’s time.
