        <p>Ongoing conflict and frequent natural disasters continue to displace populations and generate significant humanitarian needs throughout Afghanistan. The UN estimates that natural disasters, such as avalanches and floods, affect 250,000 Afghans each year, while armed conflict, displacement, and malnutrition affect nearly 8 million people.</p>

        <p>From April–September 2015, intensified conflict in northern and western areas of the country left many communities inaccessible, while flooding induced by heavy rains resulted in further inaccessibility. Relief actors faced several barriers to delivering humanitarian assistance in remote areas of the country due to security- and weatherrelated challenges, as well as limited transportation infrastructure. USAID partners Focus Humanitarian Assistance (FOCUS), International Medical Corps (IMC), and Save the Children/U.S. (SC/US) developed creative solutions to overcome access challenges, bringing assistance to conflict- and natural disaster-affected communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            USAID supports FOCUS to conduct community-based disaster risk reduction activities, including establishing stockpiles of emergency
            relief supplies in disaster-prone areas. In the aftermath of the July
            2015 floods, which damaged dozens of houses in Badakhshan Province’s
            Darwaz District, FOCUS established a cross-border agreement
            with the Government of Tajikistan to restock relief supplies—blankets,
            plastic sheeting, tents, and tools—in affected areas via alternate road
            access through the neighboring country.

        <p>Residents in SFL&#146;s project areas participated in the shelter design and construction, thereby creating a sense of ownership among those affected. Local participation ensured that the shelters rehabilitated were cost effective, adapted to local architectural methods, utilized traditional building methods and materials, and able to withstand future earthquakes. The exchange of knowledge between SFL staff and local officials greatly facilitated the construction of earthquake&ndash;resistant housing for local beneficiaries. In addition, SFL provided earthquake mitigtion training and seismic awareness preparedness to beneficiaries and local builders involved in the USAID/OFDA&ndash;funded project. Seismic risk assessments, conducted as part of the project, resulted in the relocation of three vulnerable villages consisting of 362 households.</p>
        <p>Local economic growth was another important result of the SFL shelter project. SFL&#146;s use of local building materials and labor resulted in the expenditure of 75 to 80 percent of project funds in the local economy, which generated considerable direct and indirect livelihood opportunities. Moreover, the newly reconstructed homes became a platform for home-based enterprises with 54 percent of 3,668 households utilizing their homes for income-generating activities during the life of the project. By the end of the project in November 2002, SFL constructed 5,000 two-room houses and assisted in building permanent homes for 30,522 people.</p>
        <p>As a result of the USAID/OFDA&ndash;funded shelter project&#146;s outstanding accomplishments, SFL was nominated for the 2002&ndash;2004 Aga Khan Award for Architecture, presented every three years to projects that enhance the understanding and appreciation of Islamic culture as expressed through architecture.</p>
