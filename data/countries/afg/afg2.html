<p>A crescent&ndash;shaped seismic zone extends across much of northern and eastern Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The zone is situated in the remote Hindu Kush Region, which includes the Himalayas. Between 1945 and 1999, 15 major earthquakes struck Afghanistan, causing an average of 224 deaths and 14,400 injuries annually.</p>

<p>On March 25, 2002, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck Baghlan Province in northeastern Afghanistan, adversely impacting Nahrin District. The initial earthquake was followed on March 26 and 27 by a series of aftershocks ranging between 4.5 and 5.8 in magnitude. The tremors killed nearly 2,000 people and displaced 138,000 residents in 40 affected villages.</p>

<p>In response to the damage caused by the earthquakes, USAID/OFDA provided more than $6.8 million in FY 2002 and FY 2003 to Shelter for Life (SFL) to initiate a 5,000&ndash;unit reconstruction project in May 2002. The objective of the shelter intervention was to reduce seismic hazard vulnerability by providing sustainable shelter solutions for poor and vulnerable people in disaster&ndash;prone areas, while contributing to local economic reconstruction.</p>

<p>Residents in SFL&#146;s project areas participated in the shelter design and construction, thereby creating a sense of ownership among those affected. Local participation ensured that the shelters rehabilitated were cost effective, adapted to local architectural methods, utilized traditional building methods and materials, and able to withstand future earthquakes. The exchange of knowledge between SFL staff and local officials greatly facilitated the construction of earthquake&ndash;resistant housing for local beneficiaries. In addition, SFL provided earthquake mitigtion training and seismic awareness preparedness to beneficiaries and local builders involved in the USAID/OFDA&ndash;funded project. Seismic risk assessments, conducted as part of the project, resulted in the relocation of three vulnerable villages consisting of 362 households.</p>

<p>Local economic growth was another important result of the SFL shelter project. SFL&#146;s use of local building materials and labor resulted in the expenditure of 75 to 80 percent of project funds in the local economy, which generated considerable direct and indirect livelihood opportunities. Moreover, the newly reconstructed homes became a platform for home-based enterprises with 54 percent of 3,668 households utilizing their homes for income-generating activities during the life of the project. By the end of the project in November 2002, SFL constructed 5,000 two-room houses and assisted in building permanent homes for 30,522 people.</p>

<p>As a result of the USAID/OFDA&ndash;funded shelter project&#146;s outstanding accomplishments, SFL was nominated for the 2002&ndash;2004 Aga Khan Award for Architecture, presented every three years to projects that enhance the understanding and appreciation of Islamic culture as expressed through architecture.</p>
