<p>In response to a massive tsunami on December 26, 2004 that devastated South East Asia, GOAL immediately mobilized emergency relief teams to India, Sri Lanka, the Andaman Islands and Indonesia.</p>
 
<p>In Sri Lanka alone, the tsunami killed more than 35,000 people, affected over 1 million people, and caused more than $1 billion in economic damages.</p>

<p>GOAL&#146;s Sri Lankan recovery program, which received over $3.2 million in funding from USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) along with in&ndash;kind donations, was the largest undertaken in GOAL&#146;s history. Despite the challenges, GOAL worked to develop quality programs that would provide relief quickly and have a large impact. Overall, GOAL assisted an estimated 180,000 people in three of the worst affected districts&mdash;Ampara, Hambantota and Matara.</p>

<p>In addition to the emergency provision of food, water and sanitation to 30,000 families, GOAL&#146;s OFDA&ndash;funded projects involved rebuilding or rehabilitating 62 schools; providing shelter for 2,500 displaced families through the building of 300 houses and 1,350 shelters; the rehabilitation of 6 bridges; and the repair of more than 31 miles of road.</p>

<p>Many people also lost their livelihoods as a result of the damage from the tsunami. To help jump start the economy and get people back on their feet, GOAL built four fully&ndash;equipped fish markets and four community centers; renovated 500 boats; rebuilt almost 25 miles of irrigation canals; repaired sluice gates, pumps and culverts; and planted 80,000 hardwood trees and 76,000 mangroves.</p>

<p>In respect to GOAL&#146;s school building program, the then Sri Lankan education minister remarked that it would have taken the Sri Lankan government 20 years to achieve what GOAL and OFDA had partnered to do in only 10 months.</p>
