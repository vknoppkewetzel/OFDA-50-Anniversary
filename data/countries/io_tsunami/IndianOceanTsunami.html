<p>While standing along the beachfront road, I am looking at a very calm, turquoise ocean, with white sandy beaches that stretch on for miles. Some would say this is paradise.</p>

<p>I find it somewhat surreal to be this close to the same ocean that killed thousands of people just a few days before. The people of Sri Lanka have just survived the worst tsunami in history, which left hundreds of thousands dead and others injured, missing, and homeless. People are sitting, standing, walking, crying, and wandering aimlessly looking for loved ones. All are wondering what to do next.</p> 

<p>I am here to help coordinate relief activities with USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). OFDA is in Sri Lanka to help meet the immediate needs for food, water, shelter, and sanitation. My job is to work with my team and our implementing partners to ensure this aid is distributed to internally displaced persons, many of whom are now living in temporary camps after losing their homes.</p>  

<p>As time goes on, families are able to leave the camps and return to what is left of their homes to try and reestablish their lives. This is a very difficult time to coordinate aid as it&#146;s not always easy to track and maintain a consistent flow of relief supplies. With the nonstop workload and the long hours, it&#146;s easy for me to become overly focused on the mission at hand and not notice the little things. This was never more obvious than on one particular day, while I was working in the middle of an area that had been devastated. Out of nowhere, a young girl came up to me and said hello. I took the young girl&#146;s picture with a digital camera and showed it to her. She smiled and ran away.</p>

<p>The following day, while I was coordinating another work project in the area, this same young girl came up and smiled. She was wearing a very pretty blue dress. This young girl had me take her picture again so she could see it on the camera. Then, without saying a word, she grabbed my hand and led me through a path of destruction to what was left of her home. What I found there was her mom, dad, brothers, and grandma all cleaning debris. They had nothing left. The young girl gathered her family and asked me to take a picture of them. She smiled as she looked at the picture on the back of the camera and explained to me in broken English that she wishes she could have the picture.</p> 

<p>Three days later, I returned with a color copy of the family photo I had taken. By this time, the family had been given a tent for shelter, and the young girl took the picture and hung it on the side of the tent.</p> 

<p>With all the death and destruction surrounding this young girl and her family, this one picture has become one of the most cherished items they now have. This whole episode made me realize that while you need to have essentials like food, water, and shelter to survive, you cannot forget the little things that make life better&mdash;like a picture&mdash;especially when you have lost everything. The photo captured a moment in time&#133;moments that need to be cherished because life is too short.</p>
