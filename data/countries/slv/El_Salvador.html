<p>At noon on January 23, 2001 a baby boy named Jose Rodolfo was born underneath a make&ndash;shift shelter of plastic sheeting in El Salvador. Ten days prior a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the coastline, completely destroying his family&#146;s home made of adobe blocks and a clay roof. As aftershocks continued, his mother Ana Patricia Rosales and the rest of the family were afraid to use the partial walls of their home that were left standing, so they erected the shelter that baby Jose was born in. Fortunately, USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and partner Global Communities were already on the ground to help families like the Rosales. That day, Global Communities, with the help of Jose&#146;s father, constructed a new shelter for the family&mdash;ensuring that baby Jose spent his first night in a new home with sturdy walls to protect him.</p>

<p>&#147;This sort of event puts our work in perspective. The cycle of life continues, and we must work towards a better life for little Jose and future generations,&#148; said Global Communities&#146; former Country Director for El Salvador, Brian Holst.</p>

<p>Exactly one month later, yet another earthquake hit the country, this time at a magnitude of 6.6.</p> 

<p>Thousands of students were just starting their classes as the earthquake hit, severely damaging the infrastructure of schools. OFDA delivered emergency schoolroom assistance to heavily damaged schools and helped provide temporary classrooms consisting of a corrugated tin roof and sheeting walls. More than 70 provisional school rooms were built across 15 affected municipalities, helping several children maintain their schooling. Students, teachers, parents and community members were all grateful and happy that the children&#146;s education would not be interrupted thanks to OFDA&#146;s help.</p>

<p>The two earthquakes were felt throughout El Salvador, as well as in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras. In total, the earthquakes killed 1,159 people and affected more than 1.5 million people.</p>
