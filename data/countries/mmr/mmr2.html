        USAID provided technical
        support to Burma&#39;s EOC to
        enhance disaster response
        coordination and increase
        emergency preparedness.

<p>Burma faces a number of natural hazards, including cyclones, floods,
and earthquakes, that can cause significant loss of life, livelihoods,
and assets and require a national or international response. For example,
Cyclone Nargis made landfall in Burma&#39;s Irrawaddy Delta in
May 2008, resulting in more than 140,000 deaths, displacing 800,000
people, and devastating the agriculture and fishing sectors. The severe
effects of Cyclone Nargis and other natural disasters underscored
the need to strengthen national emergency preparedness in
Burma and highlighted the importance of coordinating relief activities
among Government of Burma (GoB) agencies, local and regional
relief organizations, and the international humanitarian community. </p>

<p>
To help the GoB improve disaster response at the national level
and better coordinate regional and international assistance,
USAID has worked closely with the Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA) to provide technical support to the GoB Emergency
Operations Center (EOC), which officially began operations
in 2015. In 2013, USAID facilitated conversations between GoB
representatives and disaster management experts from the U.S.
Forest Service (USFS). In subsequent years, USAID supported
the placement of a USFS advisor at the EOC to improve center
operations and assist GoB leadership with implementing a national
disaster management system. USAID, USFS, and other U.S.
Government officials also facilitated several workshops and events
to support GoB efforts to strengthen EOC coordination, management,
and operations. The workshops and events reached representatives
from more than 20 GoB ministries and departments, the
UN, non-governmental organizations, and private sector partners. </p>

<p> When storms, floods, and landslides affected 12 of Burma&#39;s 14
states and regions from July to September 2015, EOC staff implemented
the newly developed disaster management system for the
first time. The EOC enabled 24-hour emergency assistance, facilitated
greater inter-governmental coordination than in any previous
disaster, produced comprehensive and transparent situation reports,
and expedited travel authorizations that afforded relief actors
unprecedented humanitarian access. Additionally, the EOC
pioneered the coordination of GoB activities with the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations Coordinating Center for Humanitarian
Assistance (AHA Center), the Myanmar Red Cross Society, and
UN agencies. Following the initial floods response, EOC staff met
with GoB Vice President U Nyan Tun and local government officials
to develop a national recovery framework. Recognized for its
success by the GoB and international humanitarian community,
Burma&#39;s EOC, with the support of USAID and JICA, has improved
the quality and speed of disaster response in the country. </p>
