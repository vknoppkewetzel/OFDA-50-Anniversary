<p><strong>July 26, 1963, Yugoslavia (present&ndash;day Macedonia)</strong>: A devastating magnitude 6.0 earthquake rocks the city of Skopje killing 1,100 people and injuring 4,000 more. Located almost directly under the city, the earthquake destroyed 75% of the city&#146;s buildings, leaving more than 100,000 people without a home. A young Foreign Service Officer in the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, Lawrence Eagleburger&mdash;who later became the U.S. Secretary of State&mdash;recalled his frustration responding to the earthquake:<br />

<p>&#147;We needed to help, we wanted to help, but there was no one place to call in Washington. You had to call ten places at least. That was impossible from Belgrade, much less from Skopje.&#148;</p>

<p>Following the earthquake, many people and organizations around the world offered relief supplies and assistance to Skopje&mdash;earning the city the nickname &#145;The City of International Solidarity.&#146; But as Eagleburger noted, the main issue for the United States during the Skopje response was not a lack of desire to help, nor a lack of aid to give, but rather a missing mechanism to coordinate the assistance.</p>
 
<p>Fast forward to <strong>Today</strong>: USAID, through its Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), is leading and coordinating the U.S. government&#146;s humanitarian assistance efforts across the globe.</p>

<p>Following Skopje, a Congressional hearing uncovered the confusion over who was coordinating and leading the U.S. government&#146;s disaster assistance. It also raised the question of what exactly the United States could do during an overseas emergency. After four months of hearings, USAID was assigned the &#145;Disaster Relief Coordination&#146; role&ndash;followed shortly by the formal establishment of what has now become OFDA. Since then, OFDA has responded to more than 2,500 disasters in more than 80 percent of the globe&mdash;saving countless lives. And for 50 years now, OFDA has worked on behalf of the American people in some of the world&#146;s most dangerous and complicated regions to provide humanitarian assistance to those most in need.</p>

<p>Within OFDA, Skopje is still remembered as a starting point from which the Office has progressed&mdash;learning and adapting with each disaster response. Part of this evolution has also involved investing in innovative ways to help communities better withstand future disasters&mdash;and OFDA is doing just that in the heart of the Balkans where Skopje&#146;s earthquake started it all.</p>
 
<p>Skopje is now part of an OFDA&ndash;funded project designed to help reduce future earthquake death tolls&mdash;the Global Earthquake Model (GEM). GEM, a public&ndash;private partnership, provides people and organizations with the resources to assess earthquake risks anywhere in the world. Through an open&ndash;source network of databases and tools, GEM offers a forum for researchers and local scientists to exchange data and ideas&mdash;all with the ultimate goal of reducing earthquake death tolls in the future.</p>

<p>In the Balkans, seismologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and local countries are collaborating to map out seismic risks using GEM tools, and regularly meeting with government agencies to hopefully prevent another Skopje. Eventually, the project will expand to other regions, which is especially important as urban populations throughout the world are increasingly developing along the earth&#146;s tectonic&ndash;plate boundaries&mdash;areas that are particularly prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Often these communities also have poorly constructed houses, leading to increased deaths and destruction once an earthquake does hit. This was tragically played out in Port&ndash;au&ndash;Prince during the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and may be the case in places like Kathmandu, Nepal, which is widely feared to be one earthquake away from utter catastrophe given its location and city layout. Once the GEM project is completed, perhaps Skopje&mdash;City of International Solidarity&mdash;will not just represent how the world came together after an earthquake, but also how the world united to prepare before disasters strike.</p>
