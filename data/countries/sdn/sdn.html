<p>In 2004, GOAL established emergency programs at two locations in Darfur, first at Kutum in North Darfur State in February and in July five months later in the Jebel Marra region of West Darfur. The programs were in response to the mass displacement of people caused by fighting between the Sudanese Liberation Army and government forces.</p>

<p>GOAL&#146;s program in Jebel Mara, supported by USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) funding of $2 million, centered on the localities of Golo, Gildu and Rokero. At the time, the Jebel Marra region was possibly the least-assisted area in Darfur, and GOAL were the first international non-governmental organization (NGO) to work in this area. The population was widely dispersed in remote villages in the mountains that were left burned and empty following the fighting. Main villages are only accessible by extremely poor roads while most of their satellite villages are only accessible by foot or donkey.</p>

<p>GOAL&#146;s OFDA-funded response quickly developed to provide support to an estimated 220,000 people through an integrated program including health, nutrition, water and sanitation, agriculture and food security and livelihoods components.</p>

<p>Because of the access and logistical problems involved in reaching people in need, this program included road repairs to facilitate the distribution and transportation of shelter materials, household goods, seeds and tools, food, and medicines. These repairs improved living conditions among the war affected population. Over 8.5 miles of the worst road sections were repaired enabling GOAL to distribute 513 metric tons of seeds to a total of 30,000 farming families in the area. The improved roads also allowed access for GOAL&#146;s mobile health clinic to Killin village (south of Golo) twice each week.</p>

<p>OFDA&#146;s funding also allowed GOAL to rehabilitate and support seven public health clinics and a therapeutic feeding center and to run an extensive supplementary feeding program with further outreach to four additional feeding centers.</p>

<p>&#147;The OFDA-funded GOAL project in Jebel Mara remains etched in my mind almost 10 years later. Under the integrated livelihoods program, Jebel Mara became a real food production success story. In 2004 prior to the intervention, the area produced 11,000 metric tons of food. In 2005 it reached almost 40,000 metric tons, 14,000 more than was actually needed, meaning that Jebel Mara began to feed its neighbouring regions due to this program. A staggering success thanks to the supportive and creative approach by OFDA with GOAL.&#148;</p>
