<p>In mid&ndash;1999, GOAL (with support from USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)) expanded its work in the Balkans region to Kosovo to help returning refugees from neighboring Albania prepare for the winter. The town of Pej&#235;, which was devastated during the war when Serb forces destroyed 90 percent of its homes and public buildings, served as GOAL&#146;s base.</p>

<p>For 5 months (September 1999 &ndash; January 2000) the GOAL OFDA program in Kosovo worked to restore 300 houses to make them habitable for winter&mdash;ensuring that approximately 2,100 people had a warm home.</p>

<p>These &#145;winterization&#146; efforts included providing plastered walls; temporary window frames with clear plastic panes; doors; electrical hook&ndash;up; stove and water/sanitation facilities. This was all installed after the construction of a full, timber&ndash;framed, plastic covered roof.</p>

<p>As well as grant funding, OFDA supplied donations such as roofing, stoves, timber, and water, sanitation, and hygiene items (sinks, showers, toilets etc.) to the GOAL program in Kosovo.</p>

<p>Specifically, the program tried to reach ethnic Albanians who had either fled as refugees to neighboring countries or remained in Kosovo as internally displaced persons in the mountains to the west of Pej&#235;.</p>

<p>Another goal of the program was to kick&ndash;start the local construction industry by contracting Pej&#235; construction companies to do the required repairs to the houses. Using seven independent contractors from the immediate Pej&#235; area or nearby Prizren, GOAL employed 241 people to undertake the emergency winterization of the targeted houses.</p>

<p>Alan Glasgow, currently GOAL&#146;s Director of Business Development, was part of GOAL&#146;s team in Kosovo:

<blockquote>
<p>&#147;Standing on the Kosovo Albania border in those early weeks of the crisis in April 1999 watching almost half a million people cross over in search of refuge from the unfolding crisis was profound. Myself and rest of the GOAL team assembled just outside Kukes, a small town whose population grew from 18,000 to over 400,000 in a matter of weeks, and distributed emrgency supplies. This was the start of what would, with the support of OFDA, go on to be GOAL&#146;s largest program at that time.&#148;</p>
