<p dir="ltr"><span style="color:#16B0C1;font-size: 21px;font-weight: 700;">Providing Strategic Humanitarian Assistance in Developed Countries</span><br />
<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Alison Lapp</span>

<p>In the years leading up to 2011, USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) was no stranger to cooperating with New Zealand to respond to disasters&mdash;just not on their own soil. But when a devastating magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck New Zealand on February 22, the country that had so often worked alongside OFDA to send first responders and provide humanitarian assistance to developing nations suddenly faced needs within its own borders.</p>

<p>The U.S. government (USG) was quick to offer assistance to our long&ndash;standing partner, and, despite being more accustomed to responding in countries with poor infrastructure, limited government capacity, and a large international relief agency presence, OFDA rapidly identified ways to respond to specific needs in a country that already had strong national systems in place to manage the overall response. OFDA&#146;s experiences in New Zealand helped prepare and define approaches to USG humanitarian assistance in developed countries.</p>

The February 22 earthquake in New Zealand precipatated an atypical response for OFDA&mdash;prompting a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to deploy to a developed nation with robust domestic response capacities. New Zealand had made significant investments in disaster preparedness through comprehensive building codes and early warning systems, which saved many lives during the crises. Although OFDA was historically more likely to interact with New Zealand as a fellow donor than as a nation requiring aid, the earthquake revealed that any country, when faced with a disaster of significant magnitude, may require and request international assistance.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">Strategically Filling Specific Gaps Based on Identified Needs</span><br />
OFDA assessed that the USG role was appropriately limited to addressing only a very small set of needs that exceeded New Zealand&#146;s ability to respond. This included Urban Search&ndash;and&ndash;Rescue (USAR) support due to the limited number of national teams available to respond to a disaster of this magnitude.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">Effective Interagency Responses</span><br />
Daily OFDA assessments confirmed that Government of New Zealand (GoNZ) efforts were aptly meeting the majority of humanitarian needs. Therefore, OFDA&#146;s response was restricted to activating an existing agreement with the L.A. County Fire Department to send a USAR team. The team augmented the capacity of local firefighters to search for survivors trapped in buildings and provided engineering advice to local officials as they decided whether to demolish or rehabilitate damaged structures.</p> 

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">Coordinating International Responders and Systematizing Assistance Requests</span><br />
To help New Zealand firefighters divide and assign duties to the international teams participating in USAR efforts in Christchurch, some members of the L.A. County team joined the staff of the GoNZ&ndash;led On&ndash;Site Operations Coordination Center (OSOCC), a structure that allows affected countries to coordinate international USAR efforts following a disaster. Although the GoNZ had never run an OSOCC before, with U.S. support, the center linked international rescue personnel to local authorities and facilitated the coordination of many international USAR teams&mdash;an action critical to ensuring optimal rescue efforts.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, OFDA found a capable national government with established systems for disaster response that was nonetheless overwhelmed by the severity of the disaster that occurred on its soil. By calling forward interagency specialists and aiding in the coordination of the international or non&ndash;governmental aspects of the responses, OFDA was able to provide strategic assistance targeted to the areas where the otherwise effective developed governments needed support.</p>
