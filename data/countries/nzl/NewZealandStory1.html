<p>Behind the simple statistics stemming from the Christchurch earthquake response&mdash;that American Urban Search&ndash;and&ndash;Rescue(USAR) teams cleared &#147;16 blocks of homes and 23 office buildings&#148;&mdash;is the larger story of what those numbers meant to the people personally affected by the earthquake. Following an event of this magnitude, the confustion, anxiety, and general departure from &#147;normal&#148; experienced by the people of Christchurch is something that only those who have experienced a similar trauma can fully understand.</p> 

<p>In the aftermath of the quake stood block after block of partially or fully collapsed homes too hazardous to enter. Thousands of concerned homeowners and families remained vigilant outside the structures, still uncertain in many cases of the safety or whereabouts of loved ones, pets, and personal mementos. The methodical &#147;house&ndash;to&ndash;house&#148; search and clearing of homes by U.S. government rescue teams, including their personal and professional assurance to the residents immediately following a search that the structure was &#147;clear,&#148; brought enormous relief and peace of mind to many during a critical time. The work of the U.S. team went far beyond areas where only U.S. citizens may have been trapped and instead prioritized the needs of all in Christchurch. This all&ndash;encompassing approach, in my opinion, was the real help we gave to our friends in New Zealand.</p>
