<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Loren Hyatt</span>

<p>Before OFDA&ndash;supported programs began in Sayo Elu&#146;s village in southwestern Ethiopia, she had no personal assets and no role in household decision&ndash;making. Sayo spent much of her day walking three hours from her village to collect water for her family, which was often unsafe to drink. Sayo&#146;s husband worked and provided for Sayo and their five children.</p>

<p>The area where Sayo lives&mdash;in Hamer District in rural Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region&mdash;was hit hard by the 2011/2012 drought crisis in the Horn of Africa. Facing persistent drought conditions, farmers were unable to grow crops to sell on the market or even provide enough food for their families. Villages like Sayo&#146;s also experienced water shortages, limiting the supply of safe drinking water for both people and livestock. In addition, poor hygiene and sanitation conditions in Sayo&#146;s village led to the spread of debilitating waterborne diseases, such as cholera, which worsened health conditions among those already suffering from acute malnutrition.</p>

<p>Sayo became involved with community&ndash;based learning in action hygiene and sanitation activities, which aim to motivate communities to adopt healthier behaviors. Through these OFDA&ndash;funded WASH interventions, Sayo learned the reasons behind many of the illnesses that afflict her family and others in her village, helping her better understand how to prevent them. In an effort to improve community health, Sayo began to share her new knowledge, such as improved hand washing and other sanitary practices, with others throughout her village.</p>

<p>When the program expanded to other areas of the district, Sayo was one of five pioneering women to become a paid community facilitator. Sayo left her home and traveled to other villages to pass along her knowledge. Despite being in a new community and facing the challenge of instructing men who were not accustomed to female leaders, Sayo effectively encouraged communities outside of her own to practice better hygiene and sanitation habits.</p>

<p>After working for five months as a community facilitator far from home, Sayo returned to her village with enough money to purchase food and other essential items for her family. Sayo had also saved money to purchase goats as an investment in her family&#146;s financial future. Sayo continues to spread awareness of improved sanitation practices through social visits and other travel to surrounding villages. After working with OFDA partners in the field, Sayo&#146;s understanding of how diseases are transmitted has increased. She now believes the majority of diseases found in her community can be prevented through behavioral change, community discussion and awareness about sanitation conditions, and improved personal hygiene.</p>

<p>In and around Sayo&#146;s village, OFDA refurbished 15 wells that increase access to safe drinking water for drought&ndash;affected communities. These OFDA programs also promoted improved hygiene and sanitation practices among an estimated 7,200 individuals between February and June 2012. Prior to the 2011/2012 drought crisis, many other Ethiopians like Sayo benefited from WASH assistance provided through other USAID development&ndash;focused programs in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>While the OFDA&ndash;funded portion of this WASH program has concluded with the end of drought conditions in Ethiopia, USAID and other donors continue to support WASH interventions in Sayo&#146;s community and surrounding areas, supporting improved hygiene and sanitation practices and investing in a safer future for communities like Sayo&#146;s.</p>
