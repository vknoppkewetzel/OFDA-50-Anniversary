programs in Chile helped
ONEMI respond rapidly and
effectively to a magnitude
8.3 earthquake and tsunami
in September 2015.</span>

        <p>USAID has partnered with the Government of Chile (GoC) for
more than two decades to strengthen the GoC’s ability to
prepare for and respond to natural disasters. Following a
magnitude 8.8 earthquake and resultant tsunami that caused
more than 500 deaths in Chile in 2010, USAID began focusing
its disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts on working with the GoC
to bolster its tsunami preparedness capacity and establish a
national seismic monitoring system that also contributes to
tsunami forecasting. </p>

<p> USAID has also supported trainings for emergency responders
in Chile that increased emergency preparedness and enhanced
skills in medical first response, urban search and rescue
(USAR), and coordination during a disaster. Between 2010 and
2014, USAID and Chile’s National Emergency Management
Office (ONEMI) trained more than 1,000 professional and
volunteer responders and formed a cadre of approximately
140 responders capable of training their colleagues. </p>

<p>The collaboration between USAID and the GoC has proven
effective. On September 16, 2015, a magnitude 8.3 earthquake
struck central Chile, triggering a tsunami and testing the GoC’s
response capacity. Employing the seismic monitoring system
developed with USAID support, ONEMI reacted quickly and
effectively, issuing a tsunami warning and evacuating up to 1
million people from coastal areas, undoubtedly saving lives.
ONEMI led the earthquake and tsunami response without
international assistance, with fewer than 30 casualties reported.  </p>

<p>USAID plans to continue working with the GoC to further
strengthen its disaster response capacity. Shortly after the
September earthquake, USAID supported the 2015 Regional
Earthquake Response Simulation Exercise (SIMEX) in Chile’s
capital city of Santiago. Hosted by ONEMI and led by the UN
International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG),
SIMEX strengthened first responders’ ability to conduct USAR
operations and coordinate effectively with relief agencies during
an earthquake response. In consultation with Chilean
counterparts, USAID is developing a five-year DRR plan that
includes activities such as increasing disaster preparedness in
urban areas and strengthening early warning systems. </p>
