<p>In the wake of USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)&#146;s 50th birthday, and the recent 20&ndash;year anniversary of the Rwandan genocide, there&#146;s no better time to remember OFDA&#146;s work during that historic and horrific event.</p>

<p>In 1994, Samaritan&#146;s Purse was a young relief agency. We saw the need inside Rwanda, and we responded by going there with emergency supplies. We saw it as a relatively straightforward formula&mdash;go toward the need, find out what we could do to help, and work hard to provide as much relief as possible.</p>

<p>We set up camp in a small village named Rutare, where 10,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) had gathered for safety, and agreed to supply medical care to them for 90 days. Little did we know that within three weeks the population would exceed 125,000 people. We were quickly overwhelmed by the surging need for medical care, clean water, shelter, and food. We also faced the responsibility of caring for 900 unaccompanied minors&mdash;430 of them orphans. With the desperate need for additional resources, I wrote a short proposal&mdash;my very first one&mdash;to OFDA. The request was for $43,000 for two emergency health kits. I received word back quickly that the proposal had been approved&mdash;those supplies and medicines saved thousands of lives.</p>

<p>In mid&ndash;July, the fighting subsided in the valley below us. Four of us decided to try to travel to the capital, Kigali, despite numerous military road blocks. We made it before nightfall and wound up knocking on the door of the UN Development Program (UNDP) offices, asking for a place to stay. There, we met Kate Farnsworth, an OFDA officer who had been hunkered down in Kigali during the heaviest fighting. She and the UN staff extended hospitality to us, and my team and I stayed with them for about a week. The first time I ever used a satellite phone in my life was during my stay there, and it belonged to the UN.</p>

<p>When the fighting subsided, we relocated our entire team to Kigali and reopened 400 beds of the Central Hospital at Kigali (CHK). The hospital had been looted and vandalized during the massacres that were committed there. We asked OFDA to help us purchase equipment and supplies to reopen the hospital, and were told to write the obligatory proposal&mdash;my second.</p>

<p>Again, OFDA quickly came through with $870,000, which provided just what we needed to reestablish essential services to a needy population. We managed CHK for nearly two years.</p>

<p>Looking back, I have always admired that USAID was in the right place at the right time with the right resources for Rwanda in 1994. Later, I had the opportunity to be the Director of OFDA, and the organization continues to hold my highest respect and admiration.</p>
