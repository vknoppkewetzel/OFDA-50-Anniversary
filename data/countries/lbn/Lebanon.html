<p>In 1975, Beirut&#146;s streets became a battleground for Christian and Muslim militias. Christian gunmen ambushed a bus carrying mainly Palestinian passengers in Beirut, spurring 15 years of sectarian conflict that killed nearly 150,000 people and left the country&#146;s economic and social infrastructure in ruins. Fierce artillery exchanges and rocket attacks left homes, schools, hospitals, and industrial plants severely damaged in both the Christian East and Muslim West sides of the city. Activity at the international airport and Beirut&#146;s main port was paralyzed. The heavy shelling of fuel storage facilities and water and electric power stations led to severe shortages of water, fuel, and electricity and the virtual shutdown of industry. Adding to the hardship of employment loss was the highly inflated cost of goods as scarcities drove prices skyward.</p>

<p>USAID never closed its doors in Lebanon, providing relief assistance&mdash;through its Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)&mdash;throughout the civil war. This included emergency medical aid and support to non&ndash;governmental organizations working on the ground, such as Catholic Relief Services, to locally purchase medicine and supplies as well as to repair and replace generators for private hospitals. OFDA also provided milk, warm blankets, and other basic aid to people in need in the hardest hit neighborhoods. Fuel for hospitals was locally procured to help both Christian and Muslim institutions in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, and mobile teams were able to get water to displaced families in shelters.</p>  

<p>Today, Lebanon still wears the scars of war as the country&#146;s oldest buildings are marked with gunshot holes and current events across the region feel all too similar to the violent years of past. Museums commemorate the more than 17,000 people who went missing during the war, and several Lebanese who fled the violence in the 70s and 80s still have not returned permanently. In 2006 when war broke out yet again&mdash;this time between Israel and Hezbollah&mdash;OFDA alongside its partners built upon years of local experience to provide life&ndash;saving assistance throughout the crisis. By building on the strengths of Lebanese civil society and years of in&ndash;country experience, OFDA programs have provided rapid, effective, and much&ndash;needed assistance to people in need.</p>
